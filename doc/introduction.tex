\indent\indent Digital Image Correlation (or DIC) is used in several domains and mainly in engineering and sciences. It employs different techniques to track markers placed on images and provides accurate measurement results of changes in those images. Users can acquire displacements, strains fields along with other information in a simplified manner.\\
\newline
\indent The PythonDIC software comes with a variety of functions and algorithms to accompany you through the process of image correlation. This documentation offers an overview of the software capabilities.\\
\newline\indent Software updates are released regularly and this documentation may not be fully comprehensive with upcoming functions. Please visit the github project (Python\_DIC) to get last updates information.
